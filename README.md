# FlavaQuest

## Description
Have you ever wondered how to make certain foods, or wondered where I can find more of that food. Here comes FlavaQuest. FlavaQuest allows you to take a picture of any food and gives you a summary of the food, where you can find more, what other cultures call it and how to make it at home. It lets you finish your quest for flavor.

## Getting Started
To get started contributing to this app you will need a few things first. Here are the steps to installing and using the application.

1. Install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).
1. Use text editor of your choice. I suggest [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). All examples moving forward will be shown on VSCode.
1. Fork the project and open it up in your editor of choice.
1. Open up the terminal by pressing ``ctrl + ` `` on **VS Code** and run the following commands.
    ```
    cd FlavaQuest
    npm install
    
    npx expo start
    ```
1. Install the [Expo Go app](https://expo.dev/go) on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer.
1.  On Android, use the Expo Go app to scan the QR code from your terminal to open your project. On iOS, use the built-in QR code scanner of the default iOS Camera app.

Now that you have successfully run the app. Any changes you make on in the code will be reflected in the app.

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).


## Contributing 
When you are contributing to the project please follow these guidelines to keep code consistent and easy to read.

1. **Naming Conventions:**
    * Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and components.
    * Follow camelCase for naming variables and functions, and PascalCase for naming components.

2. **Comments:**
    * Include comments to explain complex logic, edge cases, or non-obvious functionality.
    * Write comments in clear and concise language, avoiding unnecessary or redundant comments.

3. **Code Reviews:**
    * Review each other's code to make sure it's easy to understand and follows the same rules. 
    * Provide constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement during code reviews.

4. **Organizing Files:**
    * Keep files and folders organized in a logical way, like organizing papers in different folders. For example, keep all components in one folder, styles in another, and so on.

5. **Pull Request**
    * A pull request (PR) is a way to propose changes to the codebase. It allows team members to review the changes before they are merged into the main codebase.
    * How to create a Pull Request:
        * Create a new branch.
        * Make your changed on the branch.
        * Commit your changes.
        * Push your change.
        * Go to GitHub repository page. GitHub will detect the new branch you pushed and display a "Compare & pull request" button. Click it to create a pull request.
        * Write a detailed description of the changes you made in the pull request. This helps reviewers understand the purpose of your changes.
        * Submit the pull request.
